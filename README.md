Hi, I’m Christina, my pronouns are she/her/hers! 👋

<br>

**Why am I here?** ✨ <br>

I've been looking for new ways to take my Program Manager experiences to the next level and coding made perfect sense given my passions and experiences in Technology. So far, it's been an amazing outlet and experience for me. I'm eager to learn, evolve, and grow as a developer. 

<br>


 **What do I bring to the table?** 💞️ <br>

My work has empowered and inspired team members to develop fantastic products and applications that provide real-world benefits to clients. Leaders and stakeholders have relied on me to analyze data and emerging technology trends to drive innovation best practices internally. 

I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects that promote accessibility and educate others on the intersections between innovative technology and DEI work!

<br>

 **What are my professional goals?** 💼 <br>

To use my position in technology to help other BIPOC break down the barriers to entry in STEM fields.
